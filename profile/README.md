# Verbal People is an advocacy group for verbally-focussed people.

Being verbally-focused means having a natural affinity for **words**, **language**, and **narrative-based thinking**.. While sometimes associated with [Non-Verbal Learning Disorder](https://verbalpeople.org/nvld) (NVLD or NLD), verbal thinking represents a distinct cognitive style that brings unique strengths and perspectives to our world.

Too much of the information about being verbally-focussed portrays it as a deficiency or disorder but the truth is that almost no-one is _normal_ and the world is a better place for it!  If 10% of the population is verbally-focussed, we get richer stories and more interesting conversation than we would have otherwise.

## Verbal people have

- Strong vocabulary and language skills
- Excellence in narrative understanding
- Ability to process and retain detailed verbal information
- Strong memory for facts and conversations
- Natural storytelling abilities
- Preference for verbal explanations over visual demonstrations
- Strong analytical thinking through language
